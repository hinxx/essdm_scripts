* With "gui" option, one can see the rsync-epics.log in another window. It is just another convenient terminal to show rsync status, so one can monitor it by oneself.

* After the service is ready, one actually see the progress one by one.

* the procedure of the script is done, however, RSYNC is still in progress if network is slow. EPICS environment is not ready, but CS-Studio is ready.

## Random Failure
* Rsync procedure and CSS download might be failed from time to time, when the network connection speed is too slow. I saw some case, there is no css binary file in local disk after ansible did its job correctly.
